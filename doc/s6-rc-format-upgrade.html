<h1> The s6-rc-format-upgrade program </h1>

<p>
 s6-rc-format-upgrade is a program that is normally used
very rarely: when the s6-rc package is upgraded, some
services are currently managed with s6-rc, and the database
format has changed. This program transitions a live directory
using a database with the old s6-rc format (the one being
replaced) so that it uses a database with the new s6-rc format.
</p>

<p>
 The point is to ensure a smooth transition between different
versions of s6-rc without needing a reboot.
</p>

<p>
 s6-rc-format-upgrade is very different from
<a href="s6-rc-update.html">s6-rc-update</a> and does not
duplicate its functionality:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> <a href="s6-rc-update.html">s6-rc-update</a> updates a
live directory to use a <em>different compiled database</em>,
compiled from a different source, where services may have
changed, be renamed, etc. But it can only handle databases
with the format that it knows - the format created by the
<a href="s6-rc-compile.html">s6-rc-compile</a> binary that
comes in the same package as s6-rc-update. </li>
 <li> s6-rc-format-upgrade is the opposite: it cannot handle
service changes, it can only update a live directory to use
a compiled database corresponding to the <em>same source</em>
as the compiled database the live directory is currently
using. But it will replace an obsolete compiled database with
a compiled database that uses the new format (provided both
compiled databases come from the same source, and have just been
produced by invocation of different versions of
<a href="s6-rc-compile.html">s6-rc-compile</a>), ensuring the
s6-rc installation can live through database format changes. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Interface </h2>

<pre>
     s6-rc-format-upgrade [ -v verbosity ] [ -l <em>live</em> ] [ -t <em>timeout</em> ] [ -b ] <em>newcompiled</em>
</pre>

<ul>
 <li> <em>newcompiled</em> must be an absolute path. </li>
 <li> s6-rc-format-upgrade expects to find a compiled service database
with the <strong>new format</strong> in <em>compiled</em> </li>
 <li> <em>newcompiled</em> <strong>must</strong> be compiled from
the same source database as the current compiled database currently
being used by <em>live</em>.
 <li> s6-rc-format-upgrade then updates the live directory in <em>live</em>
so it uses <em>newcompiled</em> as its compiled database. </li>
 <li> On success, it exits 0. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Options </h2>

<ul>
 <li> <tt>-v&nbsp;<em>verbosity</em></tt>&nbsp;: be more or less
verbose. Default is 1. </li>
 <li> <tt>-t&nbsp;<em>timeout</em></tt>&nbsp;: if all
operations have not completed after <em>timeout</em>
milliseconds, complain and exit 1. </li>
 <li> <tt>-l&nbsp;<em>live</em></tt>&nbsp;: Work with the live state in
the <em>live</em> directory. Default is
<tt>/run/s6-rc</tt>. The default can be changed at compile time by
giving the <tt>--livedir=<em>live</em></tt> option to
<tt>./configure</tt>. </li>
 <li> <tt>-b</tt>&nbsp;: blocking lock. If <em>live</em> is currently
being used by another program, s6-rc-format-upgrade will wait until that
other program has released its lock on the directory, then proceed.
By default, s6-rc-format-upgrade fails with an error message if the live
directory is currently in use. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Typical usage </h2>

<p>
 s6-rc-format-upgrade is only necessary when the database format
changes, which only happens when s6-rc's major version number
(the third number from the right) changes. The correct order of
operations is then the following:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> Make sure your current compiled database is up-to-date
with your source database. If it's not, update it, by invoking
the <a href="s6-rc-compile.html">s6-rc-compile</a> and
<a href="s6-rc-update.html">s6-rc-update</a> binaries from your
<strong>old</strong> s6-rc installation, the ones that
understand the old format. </li>
 <li> From the same source, compile a new database with the new format,
using the <a href="s6-rc-compile.html">s6-rc-compile</a> binary
from the <strong>new</strong> s6-rc package. </li>
 <li> Update your live directories with this new database, using
s6-rc-format-upgrade. </li>
 <li> You can now remove the old databases, and delete the old
s6-rc package. </li>
</ul>
