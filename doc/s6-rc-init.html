<h1> The s6-rc-init program </h1>

<p>
 s6-rc-init is an initialization tool for the s6-rc
system. It must be run as root, at boot time, prior to any
invocation of the
<a href="s6-rc.html">s6-rc</a> binary.
</p>

<h2> Interface </h2>

<pre>
     s6-rc-init [ -c <em>compiled</em> ] [ -l <em>live</em> ] [ -t <em>timeout</em> ] <em>scandir</em>
</pre>

<ul>
 <li> <em>compiled</em>, <em>live</em> and <em>scandir</em> must be
absolute paths. </li>
 <li> s6-rc-init expects to find a <em>compiled service database</em>
in <em>compiled</tt>. It expects to be able to create a directory
at <em>live</em>. It also expects that an instance of
<a href="http://skarnet.org/software/s6/s6-svscan.html">s6-svscan</a>
is running on <em>scandir</em>. </li>
 <li> s6-rc-init initializes the live state in <em>live</em>. It
declares <em>compiled</em> as the current service database and
sets the state as "all services down". </li>
 <li> It then copies verbatim all
the service directories declared by <em>compiled</em> into a
subdirectory of <em>live</em>, adds down files to the live copies
and links them into <em>scandir</em>. It then triggers
<a href="http://skarnet.org/software/s6/s6-svscan.html">s6-svscan</a>,
which will pick up the new service directories and start
http://skarnet.org/software/s6/s6-supervise.html">s6-supervise</a>
processes on them - but the service themselves will not be started
right away, because of the down files. </li>
 <li> s6-rc-init waits for all s6-supervise processes to be
operational, then exits 0. </li>

<h2> Options </h2>

<ul>
 <li> <tt>-t&nbsp;<em>timeout</em></tt>&nbsp;: if all
s6-supervise processes are not up and running after <em>timeout</em>
milliseconds, s6-rc-init will complain and exit 111. This is a
safety feature so s6-rc-init doesn't hang indefinitely on a
nonworking installation; normally this initialization should not take
more than a few milliseconds. </li>
 <li> <tt>-c&nbsp;<em>compiled</em></tt>&nbsp;: declare <em>compiled</em>
as the current compiled service database for the upcoming live state.
Default is <tt>/etc/s6-rc/compiled</tt>. </li>
 <li> <tt>-l&nbsp;<em>live</em></tt>&nbsp;: Store the live state into
the <em>live</em> directory, which should not exist prior to running
s6-rc-init, but should be under a writable filesystem - likely a RAM
filesystem. Default is
<tt>/run/s6-rc</tt>. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Typical usage </h2>

<p>
 Administrators should invoke <tt>s6-rc-init</tt> once, in their
early boot scripts, after s6-svscan is functional and ready to
supervise longrun services (and after its catch-all logger, if
any, has started), but before any
other initialization. (The rest of the initialization can be
written as a set of s6-rc services, and performed by just one
invocation of the <a href="s6-rc.html">s6-rc change</a> command.)
</p>

<p>
 For instance, when using an init created by
<a href="http://skarnet.org/software/s6-linux-init/">s6-linux-init</a>,
<tt>s6-rc-init</tt> should be the first command in the
<em>stage2</em> (by default <tt>/etc/rc.init</tt>) script.
