<h1> The s6-rc-bundle program </h1>

<p>
 s6-rc-bundle is a tool to add or delete bundles from a compiled
service database without having to recompile it from source.
</p>

<p>
 It is an <em>offline tool</em>, i.e. you can run it on any
compiled service database without actually having a live set
of services managed by s6-rc. However, if you do have a live
set, you can still run s6-rc-bundle on the current database (and
it is the default); it won't interfere with your normal service
operation.
</p>

<h2> Interface </h2>

<pre>
     s6-rc-bundle help
     s6-rc-bundle [ -f ] [ -l <em>live</em> ] [ -c <em>compiled</em> ] [ -b ] add <em>bundlename</em> <em>contents...</em>
     s6-rc-bundle [ -f ] [ -l <em>live</em> ] [ -c <em>compiled</em> ] [ -b ] delete <em>bundlenames...</em>
     s6-rc-bundle [ -f ] [ -l <em>live</em> ] [ -c <em>compiled</em> ] [ -b ] multiple <em>args...</em>
</pre>

<ul>
 <li> s6-rc-bundle expects to find a <em>compiled service database</em>
in <em>compiled</em>; by default it uses the service database
used by the live state in <em>live</em>. </li>
 <li> Depending on the arguments, it adds a bundle definition to this database, or
deletes a bundle definition from it, or performs multiple additions/deletions. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Options </h2>

<ul>
 <li> <tt>-c&nbsp;<em>compiled</em></tt>&nbsp;: operate on a
compiled service database in <em>compiled</em> instead of
the current live one. </li>
 <li> <tt>-l&nbsp;<em>live</em></tt>&nbsp;: assume the live
state is in <em>live</em>. This option is ignored if the
<tt>-c</tt> option has been given. Default is
<tt>/run/s6-rc</tt>. The default can be changed at package
compilation time, by giving the <tt>--livedir=<em>live</em></tt>
option to <tt>./configure</tt>. </li>
 <li> <tt>-f</tt>&nbsp;: force. s6-rc-bundle will not complain
when given a nonexisting name to delete (it will do nothing), or
when given an existing name to add (it will replace the definition).
By default, s6-rc-bundle will complain and exit when asked to delete a
nonexistent name or to add an existing name. </li>
 <li> <tt>-b</tt>&nbsp;: blocking lock. If the database is currently
being used by another program, s6-rc-bundle will wait until that
other program has released its lock on the database, then proceed.
By default, s6-rc-bundle fails with an error message if the database
is currently in use. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Exit codes </h2>

<ul>
 <li> 0: success </li>
 <li> 1: identifier already exists in service database </li>
 <li> 3: identifier not found in service database </li>
 <li> 4: invalid or corrupted service database </li>
 <li> 5: wrong identifier type for the given command </li>
 <li> 100: wrong usage </li>
 <li> 111: system call failed </li>
</ul>

<h2> Subcommands </h2>

<h3> s6-rc-bundle help </h3>

<p>
 Prints a help message on stdout.
</p>

<h3> s6-rc-bundle add <em>bundlename</em> <em>contents...</em> </h3>

<p>
 Adds a bundle named <em>bundlename</em> to the database, representing
the services listed in <em>contents</em>. The arguments in <em>contents...</em>
are resolved <em>before</em> the database is modified by the
s6-rc-bundle invocation.
</p>

<h3> s6-rc-bundle delete <em>bundlenames...</em> </h3>

<p>
 Deletes bundles listed in <em>bundlenames...</em>.
</p>

<h3> s6-rc-bundle multiple <em>args...</em> </h3>

<p>
 Performs multiple bundle deletions and additions. This subcommand is best
used in an <a href="http://skarnet.org/software/execline/">execline</a>
script, because it uses
<a href="http://skarnet.org/software/execline/el_semicolon.html">blocks</a>.
</p>

<p>
<em>args...</em> is composed of:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> One block listing bundle names that will be
deleted from the database. </li>
 <li> Zero or more addition definitions, each of them composed of:
 <ul>
  <li> One argument that is the name of the bundle to add </li>
  <li> One block listing the services contained in the
new bundle. The names in the block are resolved before any addition
or deletion is made to the database. </li>
 </ul> </li>
</ul>
