Changelog for s6-rc.

In 0.2.0.1
----------

 - Bugfix release.


In 0.2.0.0
----------

 - Added this NEWS file. :)
 - Major types overhaul to make them more POSIXly correct:
compatibility with skalibs-2.5.0.0.
 - s6-2.5.0.0 now allows longruns to report permanent failures
(when ./finish exits 125). s6-rc should pick that up automatically
and fail a longrun transition when it's the case.
 - s6-rc commands taking a lock on the live directory or the service
database now fail instantly if they're already locked. A -b option
has been added to give them the "block and wait for the lock to be
released" behaviour back.
 - Easier external interaction with the hidden s6rc-fdholder
service: the list of pipes to autofill a new fdholder with is now
taken from the data/autofilled file (previously: was a hardcoded
command line in the s6rc-fdholder run script).
