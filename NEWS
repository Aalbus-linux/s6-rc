Changelog for s6-rc.

In 0.2.1.0
----------
 - Timeouts for oneshots have been increased to 30 seconds.
 - s6-rc now sends an explicit "s6-svc -d" to a longrun when an
up transition fails.
 - s6-rc now kills subprocesses waiting on longrun transitions
when it receives a SIGINT or a SIGTERM.
   + Those two changes combined ensure that a user can interrupt
a transition that is blocked in a "service is not-ready" limbo, and
bring back the service to a known "down" state.

In 0.2.0.1
----------

 - Bugfix release.
 - Support for timeout-kill (in s6-2.5.1.0).


In 0.2.0.0
----------

 - Added this NEWS file. :)
 - Major types overhaul to make them more POSIXly correct:
compatibility with skalibs-2.5.0.0.
 - s6-2.5.0.0 now allows longruns to report permanent failures
(when ./finish exits 125). s6-rc should pick that up automatically
and fail a longrun transition when it's the case.
 - s6-rc commands taking a lock on the live directory or the service
database now fail instantly if they're already locked. A -b option
has been added to give them the "block and wait for the lock to be
released" behaviour back.
 - Easier external interaction with the hidden s6rc-fdholder
service: the list of pipes to autofill a new fdholder with is now
taken from the data/autofilled file (previously: was a hardcoded
command line in the s6rc-fdholder run script).
